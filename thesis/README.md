# IME/USP LaTeX Template

A LaTeX template for Masters and PhD dissertations/theses according to
IME/USP guidelines. Feel free to customize to your needs and, if
appropriate, send us improvements. :)

You need a working LaTeX installation, including xindy, biber and biblatex
(among other packages). The document may be compiled with "make" and this
repo includes a compiled version of it. There are lots of comments in the
"tese-exemplo.tex" and "miolo-preambulo.tex" files about the packages used
and things you might want to customize or learn more about. These comments
are in Brazilian Portuguese.

## Acknowledgements

 * Original version: Jes√∫s P. Mena-Chalco
 * Revision: Fabio Kon and Paulo Feofiloff
 * Latest updates (utf8, biblatex etc.): Nelson Lago

## TODO

 * Recent biblatex versions (2017) use "labeldate+extradate" instead of
   "labelyear+extrayear"; in a couple of years we should modify the
   files plainnat-ime.bbx and plainnat-ime.cbx accordingly.

 * The translated version of the natbib package included in the template
   is old; we should update it.
